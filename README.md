# MVVM-RollaDice
<h3> Creating a Roll a Dice App, with Room db, hilt and Jetpack Compose </h3>

<p>The app is built using clean Architecture</p>
<p>I made this app to get a better understanding of Compose Navigation, Room db and Dependency Injections using Dagger Hilt</p>
<p><b>App's Functionality</b></p>
